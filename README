Free forms
----------

Simple evaluation forms application initially designed for EPFL faculties.


Prerequisites:
-------------

Due to the tequila auth requirements, this application currently needs to run
within EPFL. Moreover, tequila seems to redirect back to the application using
HTTPS, ignoring the actual scheme passed through `application.url`. You can
manually remove the 's' in the call-back url in order to bypass this issue and
login. Alternatively, install a SSL certificate.


Setup:
------

1) Setup a database in a MySQL server. Initialize it with `sql/schema.sql`.

2) Setup default (EDIC) questionnaire data by importing `sql/init.sql`.

3) Copy `conf/setup.conf.sample` to `conf/setup.conf` and customize it to fit
your needs (host, port, database settings, e-mail settings).

4) The initial login through tequila will fill in the table `forms_users` with
your user details. Once this is done, add yourself as admin using:

    INSERT INTO `forms_admins` (`id_faculty`, `sciper`) VALUES ('2', '**YOUR_SCIPER**');

5) Make sure you copy lib/libpdflib_java.so to some place in java.library.path
